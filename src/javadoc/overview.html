<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://waarp.github.com/Waarp/" target="_top"><em>The Waarp
FTP project</em></a> 
	is a proposal of a new fresh FTP server implementation, 
	  fully in Java according to the following RFC: RFC 959, RFC 775, RFC 2389, RFC 2428, RFC 3659. 
	  It includes also extra commands like XCRC, XMD5, XSHA1, INTERNALSHUTDOWN. It is based mainly 
	  on the NETTY framework (NIO great framework support) and is tend to be really efficient, both 
	  in term of memory, threads and network bandwidth. Bandwidth limitation can be configured both 
	  in store and retrieve, per session (although only one value is set by default, but it can be 
	  changed dynamically if needed) or globally to the server and of course with no limitation at 
	  all if wanted. Limitation should be enough to change the bandwidth behaviour for instance 
	  depending on the time in the day, so as to allow to limit bandwidth usage when users are at 
	  work and in contrary to allow more speed when only batchs are running. The specificity of this 
	  project is you can adapt this software to your particular needs by: changing the pre or post 
	  action on commands (not only transfer), changing the underlying representation of files and 
	  directories (for instance with database entries), using any particular authentication mechanism.</p>
